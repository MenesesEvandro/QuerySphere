# üöÄ Future Release: QuerySphere v0.2.0 "Pulsar"

**Planned Date:** TBD

With the solid foundation of the "Orion" version established, we are thrilled to announce the next major evolution of QuerySphere: version **v0.2 "Pulsar"**.

If the first version was about delivering the best *data querying* experience, "Pulsar" is about giving you the **control and insight** of a true administrator. The name "Pulsar" was chosen to represent the two core features of this release: the **pulses of diagnostic information** provided by query templates and the **precise rhythm of automation** managed by the SQL Server Agent.

This version transforms QuerySphere from a passive tool into a proactive management and monitoring platform.

## ‚ú® Key New Features

### ‚ö° Query Template Library (Instant Diagnostics)

No more wasting time googling for that complex script to check index fragmentation or monitor locks. The Query Template Library puts the knowledge of an experienced DBA just one click away.

* **Central Knowledge Base:** A new tab in the left panel called "Templates" will list pre-built SQL scripts for common and complex administration tasks.
* **One-Click Diagnostics:** Simply click on a template like "Analyze table space usage" or "Monitor running queries," and the complete script will instantly load into the editor, ready to run.
* **Knowledge Democratization:** Enables the entire team, from junior to senior developers, to perform performance diagnostics safely and consistently.
* **Easy to Extend:** The library is based on simple `.sql` files on the server, making it trivial for the team to add their own custom scripts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è SQL Server Agent Job Management

Control your server‚Äôs automation directly from QuerySphere. Full integration with the SQL Server Agent brings one of SSMS‚Äôs most critical features to the agility of our web interface.

* **Centralized Visualization:** A new "SQL Server Agent" item in the Object Navigator will open a main grid listing all jobs, showing their status (enabled/disabled), last execution, result, and next scheduled run.
* **Real-Time Control:** "Start" and "Stop" buttons directly in the job grid allow you to execute or interrupt tasks on demand without leaving the tool.
* **Detailed History:** Click on any job to view its full execution history in a new results tab, with details about duration, success/failure status, and error messages for each step.
* **(Future of the Feature) Creation and Editing:** The foundation implemented in this version will pave the way for future job creation and editing through a complete visual interface.
